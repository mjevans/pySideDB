There is not currently a released version, though the current working version is in my github.

For the moment, please do not distribute the software this repository contains to others; however I do release this under the LGPL version 3+.

Please do feel free to make a backup, evaluate, or provide archetectural suggestions if constructive.

This file will be updated when I have a more complete version that matches my vision.
