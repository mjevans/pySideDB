I have not yet decided on a license for this software, I currently plan on selecting some 'free software' license (as denoted by the two lists here: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html ); however I've not yet taken the time to reach a conclusion about which.

For the moment, please do not distribute the software this repository contains to others.

Please do feel free to make a backup, evaluate, or provide archetectural suggestions if constructive.

This file will be updated once I have something worth having a license or selection of licenses for.
